# Changelog

All notable changes to **django-snapadmin** are recorded here. This file is a concise,
version-by-version summary; the full, prose release notes for each version live in
[`docs/releases/`](docs/releases/) (shipped in the source distribution) and online in the
project documentation.

The project follows [PEP 440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/) versioning and is in the
**beta** series (`0.1.0bN`) — the public API is stabilising but may still change before `0.1.0` stable.

## Unreleased

_Nothing yet._

## 0.1.0b1 — 2026-07-08

First beta. Completes a downstream-integrator feedback pass, hardens the dashboard, and reorganises
optional dependencies so a base install is fully permissively licensed. Carries a few breaking changes.

> Upgrading from 0.1.0a11? A few changes need action (Celery task rename, dashboard gate, deps moved
> to extras) — see [`docs/migrations/0.1.0a11_to_0.1.0b1.md`](docs/migrations/0.1.0a11_to_0.1.0b1.md).

- **Changed (BREAKING):** Celery tasks moved to `snapadmin/tasks.py` and renamed to the `snapadmin.*`
  namespace (from `api.tasks.*`) so `autodiscover_tasks()` finds them. Update every
  `CELERY_BEAT_SCHEDULE` entry and any imports; no back-compat aliases are kept.
- **Security:** the system dashboard is now staff-gated by default (it exposed hostname,
  processor, OS, database name, service health and `ALLOWED_HOSTS` to anonymous callers).
  Opt out with `SNAPADMIN_DASHBOARD_PUBLIC = True`.
- **Security:** wysiwyg field values are sanitized (via `nh3`, a new core dependency) before being
  rendered in the admin changelist; opt back into raw HTML per field with `safe_html=True`.
- **Added:** `SNAPADMIN_URL_PREFIX` relocates the entire route surface (REST, Swagger, GraphQL)
  under one extra path segment for projects that already own the mount point; route names are
  unchanged.
- **Added:** admin-only bulk ES reindex endpoint (`POST /api/es/reindex/`, gated), a deletion-veto
  hook for the dynamic model API, and synchronous `count` / streaming NDJSON `export` actions.
- **Changed:** `django-extra-settings` is now an optional extra (`django-snapadmin[extra-settings]`),
  not a forced core dependency — SnapAdmin's core never used it.
- **Changed:** the wysiwyg editor (`django-ckeditor-5`, which bundles GPL/commercial CKEditor 5) is now
  an optional `[wysiwyg]` extra, imported lazily — the base package stays permissively licensed for
  commercial use.
- **Changed:** `django-admin-autocomplete-filter` (LGPL, unused by the core) is now the optional
  `[autocomplete-filter]` extra — the base install is now **fully permissive** (MIT/BSD/Apache), no
  copyleft/commercial code by default.
- **Added:** a Python × Django compatibility matrix in the README and `Framework :: Django :: 6.0`
  / per-minor Python classifiers; the suite runs green on Django 6.0.
- **Fixed:** aggregations on SnapModels no longer return wrong grouped counts (default `-pk` ordering
  no longer leaks into `GROUP BY`); `upsert_from_source()` works on MySQL/MariaDB.
- **Fixed:** the dashboard shows the real installed version and loads no external assets
  (Chart.js + Material Icons vendored, Font Awesome dropped for an inline SVG).
- **Fixed:** `SnapPhoneField` accepts spaced international numbers (e.g. `+49 89 1234567`).
- **Fixed:** the demo seeder no longer crashes on a cp1252 Windows console.
- **Docs:** GraphQL field-naming scheme documented; per-model admin extension points
  (`admin_mixins` / `admin_overrides` / `css_admin_files` / `js_admin_files`) documented; migration
  guide install name and `/api/` collision handling corrected; a CHANGELOG now ships to pip users.

See [`docs/releases/0.1.0b1.txt`](docs/releases/0.1.0b1.txt) for the full notes.

## 0.1.0a11 — 2026-07-05

Squashed the `snapadmin` and `demo` migrations (`0001`–`0006` each) into a single
`0001_initial.py` per app. Breaking for installs that already ran `migrate` on a prior alpha
(drop/recreate the database); no model or API changes.

## 0.1.0a10 — 2026-07-05

Housekeeping only: fixed a malformed `templates/admin/index...html` filename (the admin
dashboard override was silently ignored) and replaced a debug `print()` / swallowed exception
around GraphQL URL wiring with structured `structlog` logging.

## 0.1.0a9 — 2026-07-05

Enterprise backlog: immutable audit trail, asynchronous background export, large-dataset
pagination, full i18n (10 locales), WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility, an ecosystem-compatibility matrix,
configuration health checks and a migration guide.

## 0.1.0a8 — 2026-07-05

Config-driven enterprise features: read-replica routing, an SSO/OAuth2 login helper, PII masking
and nested-app grouping.

## 0.1.0a7 — 2026-07-04

SFTP offsite backups and a `[backup]` extra, automated PyPI publishing (tag → OIDC Trusted
Publishing), PyPI project URLs, and a docs split (package vs demo) with an Extending guide.

## 0.1.0a1 – 0.1.0a6

Initial alpha series: the declarative `SnapModel` + `Snap*` field types, auto-generated Unfold
admin, REST API with Swagger, dynamic GraphQL, Elasticsearch integration and smart `?search=`
routing, email error monitoring and 3-2-1 database backups. See the online release notes for
detail.
